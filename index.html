        Fitness and health are closely related concepts. Fitness refers to the
        ability of the body to perform physical<br />activities, while health
        refers to the overall state of the body, including physical, mental, and
        social well-being.<br />
        Being physically fit is important for maintaining good health. Regular
        exercise, such as cardiovascular<br />
        exercise and strength training, can help improve cardiovascular health,
        increase muscle mass, and decrease <br />body fat. It can also help
        reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and
        certain types<br />
        of cancer. Proper nutrition is also important for maintaining good
        health. A well-balanced diet that includes a<br />
        variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy
        fats can help provide the nutrients needed<br />
        for optimal health. Adequate hydration is also essential for good
        health, as water helps regulate body<br />
        temperature, transport nutrients, and remove waste products. In addition
        to physical health, mental and<br />
        social health are also important for overall well-being. Engaging in
        activities that promote mental health, <br />such as meditation,
        mindfulness, and therapy, can help reduce stress and improve mood.
        Maintaining strong<br />
        social connections and support systems can also help improve overall
        health and well-being.<br />
        Overall, fitness and health are important for living a fulfilling and
        enjoyable life. By taking care of our bodies and minds through regular
        exercise, healthy eating, and other wellness practices, we can improve
        our quality of life and reduce the risk of chronic disease.<br /><br />
        <b>Some interesting facts related to health and fitness are:</b>
        <br />1. According to the World Health Organization, physical inactivity
        is the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality, causing an
        estimated 3.2 million deaths globally each year. <br />
        2. Regular exercise can help improve cognitive function and reduce the
        risk of cognitive decline and dementia.<br />3. Poor sleep is associated
        with a higher risk of obesity, heart disease, and other chronic
        conditions, while regular exercise can improve sleep quality.<br />
        4. Resistance training, such as weightlifting, can help increase muscle
        mass and strength, improve bone density, and reduce the risk of falls
        and fractures in older adults.<br />
        5. A diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and
        healthy fats can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart
        disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer.<br />
        6. Stress can have negative effects on both physical and mental health,
        but regular exercise can help reduce stress levels and improve mood.<br />
        7. Sitting for long periods of time can be detrimental to health, but
        taking regular breaks to stand up and move around can help counteract
        the negative effects.<br />
        8. Maintaining social connections and participating in community
        activities can help improve overall health and well-being.<br />
        9. It's never too late to start exercising or making healthy lifestyle
        changes - even small improvements can have significant benefits for
        health and longevity.<br />
        10.Exercising regularly helps boost your immune system. This means
        you'll get sick less often than people who don't exercise.

        <div class="nutrition-content">
          <h3>Why Nutrition is Important?</h3>
          <p>
            Nutrition plays a critical role in maintaining good health and
            preventing chronic diseases. A balanced diet that is rich in
            nutrients, vitamins, and minerals is essential for optimal health
            and well-being. Eating a variety of foods from all food groups is
            important to get the nutrients your body needs to function properly.
            <br /><br />
            Nutrients are classified as <b>Macronutrients</b> and
            <b>Micronutrients</b>.
          </p>
          
          <div class="macro">
            <h4>Macronutrients:</h4>
            <p>
              Macronutrients are the nutrients that the body requires in larger
              quantities. These include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.
              Carbohydrates are the body's main source of energy, while proteins
              are important for building and repairing tissues. Fats are
              important for energy and cell growth, but too much fat in the diet
              can lead to health problems.

          </div>
          <div class="macro-content">
            <div class="macro-item">
              <h5>Carbohydrates</h5>
              <img src="images/carbohydrates.jpg" alt="Carbohydrates" />
              <p>
                Carbohydrates provide energy for the body and are found in foods
                like bread, pasta, rice, and fruits. Carbohydrates are divided
                into two main types: simple and complex. Simple carbohydrates,
                also known as sugars, are found in foods like candy, soda, and
                baked goods. Complex carbohydrates, on the other hand, are found
                in foods like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.

            <div class="macro-item">
              <h5>Fats</h5>
              <img src="images/fats.jpg" alt="Fats" />
              <p>
                Fats are important for maintaining cell function and hormone
                production. They are found in foods like nuts, seeds, and
                oils.When it comes to fat intake, it's important to aim for a
                balance of different types of fats in your diet. Experts
                recommend that adults get between 20-35% of their daily calories
                from fats, with most of that coming from unsaturated fats.

              <h5>Protein</h5>
              <img src="images/protein.jpg" alt="Protein" />
              <p>
                Protein is made up of amino acids, which are the building blocks
                of our muscles, organs, and tissues. Protein also helps to
                repair and maintain these tissues, as well as supporting the
                immune system and producing hormones and enzymes. It is found in
                animal products like meat, fish, and eggs, as well as
                plant-based sources like beans, lentils, and tofu.

              <h4>Micronutrients:</h4>
              <p>
                Micronutrients are another important category of nutrients 
                that the body needs in smaller amounts than macronutrients. 
                Micronutrients include vitamins and minerals, and they play 
                important roles in many bodily functions such as immune system 
                function, metabolism, and maintaining healthy bones, skin, and 
                eyes.

                   vitamins — vitamins A, C, D, E, K, and the B vitamins 
                   (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, biotin, B6,
